Purpose of this Vagrant project is to create a well-upgraded headless ubuntu box. 

Upon such a box we can build desktop installation in another Vagrant project.

If e g desktop box needs to be rebuild at later stage, you can rerun this project to create
a new well-upgraded headless box to build upon.
