Purpose of this Vagrant project is to create a well-upgraded headless ubuntu box. 

Upon such a box we can build desktop installation in another Vagrant project.

If e g desktop box needs to be rebuild at later stage, you can rerun this project to create
a new well-upgraded headless box to build upon.

This project is also a building kit which include tools to build other boxes, such as incuding java, adding xubuntu desktop, installing an IDE etc. Doing so should probably end with packaging and publising a new box for a specific purpose.
